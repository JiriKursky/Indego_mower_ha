The original component was created by https://github.com/jm-73/Indego
Tested only with Indego S+ 350
I only add sensor and service


![Map example](/doc/m1-map.png)

Yellow point is estimate position of Indego.

## Installation

1. In your directory /config/custom_components/ clone : https://github.com/JiriKursky/Indego. After restart of Home Assistant have to appear the new Indego sensor with position.

2. For using in map you can use AppDaemon code -I am preparing  tutorial on AppFramework https://appframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.


## Next steps

If Indego component is working you should be able in Home Assistant to call service
![service](/doc/01-service.png)

No parameters. The service should create file /config/www/indego_map.svg for using in lovelace.
